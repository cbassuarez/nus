# Product decisions

Settled 2026-09-16 in the design pass. These are the behaviours spike 4 and
the v1 crates implement; change the doc when a decision changes.

## Windows and Spaces
- **A Space is a window.** Switching Space (⌘⌥1–9) raises that window. The
  Space row at the top of the sidebar is a window switcher; the tab list is
  the current Space's only. Quick terminal and PiP are the only other windows.
- A Space owns: its signal color, a default shell profile + cwd for new
  terminal tabs, and a browser profile (CEF request context / cookie jar).
  Config overrides per Space are not v1.
- Splits: a tab is one pane or a left|right pair. No vertical splits, no
  nesting. One tab = one sidebar preview.
- Chromeless by default: 6px signal band + 30px top strip. Sidebar on ⌘⇧S.

## Quick terminal
- ⌥⌘T. Global hotkey by default (summons over any app); `quick.global =
  false` keeps it inside nus. Drops from the top edge of the active display.

## Attention ("waiting")
- Signals: BEL, OSC 9 / OSC 777 notifications, and shell integration
  (OSC 133 prompt marks → "command finished"). nus installs the shell hook
  for pwsh, bash, zsh, fish. No output-idle heuristics.
- Shown in the sidebar (filled label in the Space's signal color) and in the
  top strip summary; OS notification when the window is unfocused.

## Session restore
- On launch: Spaces (windows), tabs, splits, each terminal's profile + cwd,
  each browser tab's URL and scroll, **and each terminal's scrollback
  snapshot** as read-only history above the fresh prompt.

## Theme
- Follows the OS (paper when light, ink when dark), switches live.
  `theme = "paper" | "ink"` pins one.

## Browser
- New tab opens ⌘K; there is no new-tab page. URL or search from the palette.
- Search engine configurable (`browser.search`), default Google.
- Third-party cookies blocked by default, per-site exceptions in config.
- Downloads: silent to ~/Downloads, ruled toast with open / reveal.
- Password manager: 1Password via the `op` CLI (biometric unlock), our own
  form detection and fill. Bitwarden later.
- Import: bookmarks/history/Spaces from Chromium-family browsers (Arc, Chrome,
  Edge, Brave) — Chromium profile format, one-shot.

## Profiles
- SSH: every `Host` in ~/.ssh/config becomes an `ssh:<name>` profile.
- WSL: `wsl -l` distros become `wsl:<name>` profiles on Windows.
- "Open in nus" entry in Explorer / Finder / file managers.

## Ops
- Self-update from GitHub Releases, offered in the top strip. No telemetry.
  Crashes write a local log only.
